# Crypto Tax Calculator

A full-stack web app that aggregates your wallet transactions across Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon and generates tax-ready reports.  
The platform normalizes swaps, transfers, staking rewards, and fees, then applies IRS-compliant cost basis rules to produce Form 8949, Schedule D, and tax loss harvesting insights.
